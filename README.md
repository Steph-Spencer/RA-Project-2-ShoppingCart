This is the second project in the RED Academy Web Developer Professional program.

It was written in ES6 and built upon a foundation forked from https://github.com/eapostol/minimalES6-v01 
The project consists of a single-page web app for a fictional electronics ecommerce site
Products are populated into a carousel from the BestBuy API.
Users can click QuickView to view more details about a product, or Add to Cart to add to their shopping cart
The shopping cart uses session storage to track the contents of the shopping cart


This project is currently incomplete.
The carousel works properly, displaying a selection of laptops from the BestBuy API
The user can click Add to Cart and the quantities of the selected items are available in session storage
QuickView is currently broken and does not display when the button is clicked. There may be a conflict with the code that controls the cart view.
The Cart View is also not available until I complete debugging the code that displays the cart contents dynamically.
